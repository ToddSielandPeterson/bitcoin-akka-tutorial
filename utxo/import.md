# Import/Export

These are helpers that take a file of blocks generated by using [linearlize][1] or downloaded from the web. These files
have the best version of the blockchain (no forks) serialized block after block.

## Import

To import, update the configuration section related to import:

```
# Import
blockFiles {
  path=""
  start = 0
  checkpoints=[]
}
```

`path` points to a directory where the file or files are located. They must be named `bootstrap-XYZ.dat` where XYZ is 
a number that you put in the list of checkpoints. The import will process all of them in sequence. `start` is the 
height of the first block in the file.

Then you run with `org.bitcoinakka.BlockchainFileRead` as the main class.

## Export

To export, update the configuration section related to export:

```
# Export
saveBlocks {
  file = ""
  startHeight = 0
  endHash = "000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f"
}
```

It creates a single output file with blocks from the chain start *after* the given `startHeight` and ends at the block that
has the given `hash`. The block of given height is not included. Exporting is the equivalent of [lineralize][1].


In the next milestone, we will check the validity of the data we receive and reject incorrect blocks and transactions.
