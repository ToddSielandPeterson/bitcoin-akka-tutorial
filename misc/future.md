# From here...

Future development will move to [another repository][1] and I will leave this one unchanged except for fixing the documentation and bugs. 
It has the core feature set and is self-contained. 

Going from here, there are many things that can be done:

- Policy rules for relaying,
- Auto pruning,
- Port to other platforms,
- Wallets,
- Notification API,
- ...

I'm not sure what I'll do next though. Anyway, I hope that you had fun and learned something from this project.
